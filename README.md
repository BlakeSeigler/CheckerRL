Model Based Planning
Q-Learning
MCTS (like alphaGO)
 
# Strategies
Checkers is a game with many possible combinations. Too many to absolutely compute values. Thus for strategies I'll try out a few different strategies. 

## Model Baseed Planning
The first is a model based planner. This is a deterministic system with hard coded values for the rewards. This system when played against itself will play the same game everytime. 

## Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (IN PROGRESS)
Very common algorithm for optimization approaches where the sample space is incredibly large (like 1e171 large)

## Q-Learning (IN PROGRESS)
This is a model free off-policy method that uses a neural network to represent the quality function.
